> This is a repository where you will find topics from recent Web Development posts that [Maicon Rodrigues](https://github.com/Maiconrq) and [I (Fabrício Lopes)](https://github.com/Fabricio-Lopees) are studying. During the study we will update this repository and explain some of the topics that we have learned, with the intention of testing our knowledge and also helping others who wish to become a Web Developer.
>
> We intend to follow the [Developer Roadmap](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap) as the main study plan, but it may be that over time we add content that is not on the Developer Roadmap, but that we see the need to be studied.
