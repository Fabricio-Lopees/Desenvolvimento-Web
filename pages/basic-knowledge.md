# Basic knowledge
## Hardware
In information technology (IT), hardware is the physical part of the machine, that is, it is all the internal mechanical equipment (motherboard, video card, processor, etc.) or external (cabinet, monitor, mouse, keyboard) of a computer.

## Software
Software is the logical part, that is, they are programs and/or set of instructions to be followed and executed by the computer (text editors, games, device drivers, firmware, etc.). Software can be classified into two main types, called System software and Application software.

### System software
It is like an intermediate layer between the user and the hardware. It is extremely important software, as it manages the hardware components and provides an environment for other software to function normally. The system software helps the user and the hardware to perform functions and interact with each other. Basically, it is a type of software that manages the behavior of the computer's hardware to provide users with the necessary basic functions.

Below are some software that are part of this classification:

- **Firmware**: it is a set of instructions embedded directly in the hardware. The firmware provides instructions on how a device communicates with other hardware. The firmware is stored in the flash ROM. Although ROM (read only memory) is a read-only memory, the flash ROM can be erased and rewritten, as it is a type of flash memory, allowing firmware updates.
- **Operating Systems**: a set of software that aims to manage resources and be a layer of abstraction of hardware for the user. It will be better explained in an upcoming content!
- **Drivers**: is software that enables a specific device to communicate with the operating system. Drivers may be required for both internal devices (video card and optical media drive) and external devices (monitor and printer). Currently, the hardware is coming with plug and play technology, which means that the hardware works without installing drivers. Even though the operating system recognizes the hardware, installing the correct drivers can provide additional options and functions to the device.
- **Programming language translators**: programming language translator or processor is software that converts high-level programming language to machine language (binary), making the CPU (central processing unit) understand the instructions passed to it. There are 3 categories of translators: compiler, interpreter and assembler.
  - **Compiler**: transforms (compiles) all source code into machine (binary) code and saves the compiled code in an executable file. After the compilation process you can run the file. Since you already have code in the machine language, execution becomes faster.
  - **Interpreter**: unlike the compiler that transforms all source code into machine code and can only be executed afterwards, the interpreter transforms the source code into binary code and executes it simultaneously. The interpreter reads the first line, transforms that line into machine code and executes it, then does the same process for the next line and the rest of the source code. This process ends up taking more time than the compiled one, because basically there are three operations occurring simultaneously: reading, transformation from one code to another and execution.
  - **Assembler**: it works the same way as the interpreter, the only difference is that an assembler only converts code written in assembly language to machine code.
- **Utility software**: programs created to optimize, configure, maintain and facilitate the use of the operating system (file manager, drivers, backup tool, disk analyzer, etc.).

### Application software
These are programs that perform specific tasks and are aimed at the end user (text editors, games, browsers, etc.). Some categories of application software:

- **Database software**: they are programs with the function of managing the database. Some examples:
  - Clipper
  - MySQL
  - FileMaker
- **Words processors**: programs for creating and editing documents. Some examples:
  - Microsoft Word
  - Google Docs
  - LibreOffice Writer
- **Graphic software**: as the name says, they are programs for graphic editions, such as video, photo and other editing. Some examples:
  - Adobe Photoshop
  - GIMP
Inkscape
- **Web browsers**: applications designed to browse the internet. Some examples:
  - Google Chrome
  - Firefox
  - Brave browser
- **Educational software**: programs in order to assist learning. Some examples:
  - Anki
  - LibreOffice Math
  - Delta Drawing
- **Multimedia software**: programs that perform tasks such as: playing a song, playing a video, among others. Examples:
  - VLC Media Player
  - Dragon Player
  - Elisa
## High and low level languages
### High level
They are languages that have a syntax closer to human language. They have a higher level of abstraction, so in most of them you donâ€™t need to have in-depth knowledge of the hardware to

### Low level
It is the famous machine language (binary), with which you can communicate directly with the hardware, with a high level language it is not possible or at least it is more work. Because you can communicate directly with the hardware, you need knowledge about the architecture and functioning of a computer's internal components.

The term low level language does not refer only to the binary language, but to the languages that have a syntax closer to the binary language.

*OBS. If you hear someone saying that software is low-level, it is because it works closely or directly with the hardware, and it was probably also written with low-level languages. The same goes for high-level software, only the other way around.*
